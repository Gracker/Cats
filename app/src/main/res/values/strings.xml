        Multnomah County Animal Services (MCAS) is suspending intake of stray and community cats, except for cases where the cat is sick or injured, or in immediate danger due to cruelty, neglect, and similar circumstances. \n

        Finders of stray cats are encouraged to check for a local owner, or attempt to find an owner if the cat is lost.\n

        Following recommendations from the National Animal Care  Control Association (NACA), Multnomah County Animal Services (MCAS) is suspending intake of stray and community cats*, except for cases where the cat is sick or injured, or in immediate danger due to cruelty, neglect, and similar circumstances.\n
        \n
        The changes to limit cat intake at the Troutdale animal shelter are being implemented to reinforce social distancing measures, and manage the shelter population of cats while adoptions are suspended.\n
        \n
        At MCAS, while over 50-percent of stray dogs are successfully returned to their owners — only approximately 9-percent of cats are reunited. While these rates are significantly higher than the 2018 national average of 17.4 percent for dogs and 2.8% for cats, MCAS is continually working to improve these outcomes.</string>
